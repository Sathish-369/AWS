Scenario:
If you disabled an AMI (Amazon Machine Image) in AWS instead of deregistering it, you may encounter issues when trying to delete the associated snapshot.

Steps:

1. **Identify Disabled AMI:**
   - If you disabled an AMI and it's not visible in the GUI AMIs page, you won't be able to delete the snapshot from the AWS Management Console.

2. **Use AWS CLI (CloudShell):**
   - Open AWS CloudShell from the AWS Management Console by searching for "CloudShell" and launching it. This opens a command-line interface.

3. **Run Command to Describe the Image:**
   - Use the following command, replacing `ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49ed5` with the actual AMI ID obtained from the snapshot page.
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49ed5
     ```
-----command output--------------
$ aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxxxxx9ed5

                {

                    "VirtualName": "ephemeral0"
                },
                {
                    "DeviceName": "/dev/sdc",
                    "VirtualName": "ephemeral1"
                }
            ],

    ]

---------------------------------------------------------


4. **Check Image Description:**
   - If the image description includes `"State": "disabled"`, proceed to deregister the AMI.

5. **Deregister Disabled AMI:**
   - Run the following command, replacing `ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49ed5` with the actual AMI ID.
     ```bash
     aws ec2 deregister-image --image-id ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49ed5
     ```

6. **Confirm Deregistration:**
   - Check the status of the AMI using the describe-images command. The State should be "deregistered" or not present:
     ```bash
     aws ec2 describe-images --image-ids ami-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx49ed5
     ```

7. **Delete Associated Snapshot:**
   - Finally, you can delete the associated snapshot using its ID. Replace `snap-xxxxxxxxxxxx5b0a1` with the actual snapshot ID.
     ```bash
     aws ec2 delete-snapshot --snapshot-id snap-xxxxxxxxxxxx5b0a1
     ```

8. **Verify Deletion:**
   - Confirm that the AMI is no longer listed in describe-images, and the snapshot is deleted.

Now, you should be able to delete the snapshot from the AWS GUI or through the console without encountering errors. 

Verify that your AMI and snapshot pages are empty and correctly reflect the changes.
